twIRCk.app
==========

A Native OS X IRC client for when you feel that you just gotta TWERK it.

Another IRC client?
-------------------
twIRCk is a native OS X app that makes connecting to IRC networks easy and fun. I started this project because I could not find a single app that felt native and modern with support for fullscreen, notification center, or scripting. I feel strongly that IRC is a great way to build communities and get support on technical matters. Since I spend everyday on IRC, I wanted that time to be spent in a beautiful app that was responsive and extensible. twIRCk is that application.

Why Open Source?
----------------
twIRCk is open source because I believe that the work I do should benefit the community and the world. It is available in the Mac App Store, but if you are so inclined you may
always clone this repository and build it yourself. Open Source projects are typically more secure, more resilient, and better supported than closed source projects I've used.
